      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tiktok-owner-has-strong-first-amendment-case-against-us-ban-professors-say&#34;&gt;TikTok Owner Has Strong First Amendment Case Against U.S. Ban, Professors Say&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ch-naseem.com/images/blogs/5/1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Legal experts believe ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, has a strong First Amendment argument against the recently passed U.S. law that could force a sale or ban of the popular video sharing app. The law specifically names TikTok and ByteDance, raising concerns that it constitutes an unconstitutional &amp;ldquo;bill of attainder&amp;rdquo; by singling out a specific entity for punishment without trial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;google-open-sources-large-language-model-gemma&#34;&gt;Google Open Sources Large Language Model Gemma&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ch-naseem.com/images/blogs/4/1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google recently open sourced Gemma, a large language model with similarities to the company&amp;rsquo;s Gemini family of models. Gemma comes in two sizes - 2 billion and 7 billion parameters - and is optimized to run efficiently across devices from mobile to cloud TPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a big move by Google to spur collaboration and progress in AI research through an open model. It provides some competition to closed models like OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT-3. Gemma is available on GitHub and through Google Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Major Developments in Cybersecurity and Privacy</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;european-court-of-human-rights-rules-against-weakening-encryption&#34;&gt;European Court of Human Rights Rules Against Weakening Encryption&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ch-naseem.com/images/blogs/3/1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) issued a landmark ruling that bans governments from forcing companies to weaken end-to-end encryption for mass surveillance purposes. The court held that while authorities can monitor suspects&amp;rsquo; communications without undermining wider security, general encryption backdoors present too great a privacy risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The decision deals a major blow to controversial EU legislation proposing &amp;ldquo;client-side scanning&amp;rdquo; backdoors that would have let police search digital devices for illegal content. Critics argue this chat control plan would have made all European encrypted communications fundamentally insecure. Digital rights groups have hailed the ECHR judgement as an unprecedented win for privacy in the region.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Grim Reality of Tech Layoffs in 2024</title>
      <link>https://ch-naseem.com/blog/post2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The tech industry, once a beacon of growth and innovation, is facing a harsh reality in 2024. Layoffs have become a common occurrence, with over 33,000 employees from 132 tech companies losing their jobs in the first month of the year alone. This number surpasses the total layoffs in the tech industry for the entire year of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reasons behind these massive layoffs are multifaceted. Overestimating growth during the pandemic, leading to over-hiring, is one factor. Changing consumer behavior, with a shift towards short-form video content and a decline in app usage, has also contributed to the downturn. The rise of artificial intelligence and automation has further exacerbated the problem, making some roles redundant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;pope-francis-calls-for-international-ai-treaty&#34;&gt;Pope Francis Calls for International AI Treaty&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ch-naseem.com/images/blogs/1/1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;Earlier this week, Pope Francis released his annual World Day of Peace message, focused this year on artificial intelligence (AI) and peace. The pope called for the global community to work together to adopt a binding international treaty regulating the development and use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Francis acknowledged the impressive achievements of AI, but also highlighted the risks, like increased inequality and loss of jobs. He emphasized the need for AI systems to uphold human dignity and rights. The pope warned about the use of AI for surveillance, manipulation, and autonomous weapons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
