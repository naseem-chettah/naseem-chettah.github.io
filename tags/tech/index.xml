      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;google-open-sources-large-language-model-gemma&#34;&gt;Google Open Sources Large Language Model Gemma&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/blogs/4/1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google recently open sourced Gemma, a large language model with similarities to the company&amp;rsquo;s Gemini family of models. Gemma comes in two sizes - 2 billion and 7 billion parameters - and is optimized to run efficiently across devices from mobile to cloud TPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a big move by Google to spur collaboration and progress in AI research through an open model. It provides some competition to closed models like OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT-3. Gemma is available on GitHub and through Google Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Grim Reality of Tech Layoffs in 2024</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The tech industry, once a beacon of growth and innovation, is facing a harsh reality in 2024. Layoffs have become a common occurrence, with over 33,000 employees from 132 tech companies losing their jobs in the first month of the year alone. This number surpasses the total layoffs in the tech industry for the entire year of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reasons behind these massive layoffs are multifaceted. Overestimating growth during the pandemic, leading to over-hiring, is one factor. Changing consumer behavior, with a shift towards short-form video content and a decline in app usage, has also contributed to the downturn. The rise of artificial intelligence and automation has further exacerbated the problem, making some roles redundant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;pope-francis-calls-for-international-ai-treaty&#34;&gt;Pope Francis Calls for International AI Treaty&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/blogs/1/1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;Earlier this week, Pope Francis released his annual World Day of Peace message, focused this year on artificial intelligence (AI) and peace. The pope called for the global community to work together to adopt a binding international treaty regulating the development and use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Francis acknowledged the impressive achievements of AI, but also highlighted the risks, like increased inequality and loss of jobs. He emphasized the need for AI systems to uphold human dignity and rights. The pope warned about the use of AI for surveillance, manipulation, and autonomous weapons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
