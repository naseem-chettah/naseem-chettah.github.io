      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;european-court-of-human-rights-rules-against-weakening-encryption&#34;&gt;European Court of Human Rights Rules Against Weakening Encryption&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ch-naseem.com/images/blogs/3/1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) issued a landmark ruling that bans governments from forcing companies to weaken end-to-end encryption for mass surveillance purposes. The court held that while authorities can monitor suspects&amp;rsquo; communications without undermining wider security, general encryption backdoors present too great a privacy risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The decision deals a major blow to controversial EU legislation proposing &amp;ldquo;client-side scanning&amp;rdquo; backdoors that would have let police search digital devices for illegal content. Critics argue this chat control plan would have made all European encrypted communications fundamentally insecure. Digital rights groups have hailed the ECHR judgement as an unprecedented win for privacy in the region.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
